I smelled bacon. I thought is was my clothing or something. It wasn't my clothing. The girl next to me smelled just like a fresh, store-bought pack of 
honey-maple bacon. It was driving me wild. My first inclination was to stop her and ask for her phone number. But, that seemed rather intrusive and ill-thought.
Yum. Yum. We could go out and I could call her my little bacon girl. And sure, to some that may sound outrageous or perhaps outright disgusting maybe.
But to us, it would be a dream come true. She, blessing the world with her smoky bacon scent and me, what would I smell like? Well, I would reek of scrambled eggs of course and perhaps a side of crispy toast. We would rule the world. All who come near would relish our early morning aroma. Be ware.
And at night what would we do? We would play Gothic music and play board games like Dugeons and Dragons for hours on end. We would invite over friends
that have far too many nose piercings and faded tatoos. We would argue about the establishment and how it cares nothing for the common man and woman.
The apartment would be an utter pig-sty. Dishes would sit in the sink until encrusted with placated leftover food. It would require industrial-strength dish detergent to wash them. And the kitchen floor would be so black with dust and dirt that visitors would assume that it were not naturally white tiling. 
Oh, yeah! Life would be grand. My little pork, bacon sausage loaf and me, scrambles mc doodles.</p>
